The order processor handles every purchase made at Name.com and processed over $32M in transactions in 2016.
It integrates with almost every other service and many 3rd party APIs.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-DNS">DNS</h3>
<p>
The DNS service hosts over 1 million zones.
Created a feature to resolve ANAME records into A and AAAA records automatically and keep them updated.
Designed a system to monitor propagation of updates and verify consistency.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-DomainLifecycleManagement">DomainLifecycleManagement</h3>
<p>
The domain lifecycle management service handles expiration and deletion of domains.
This is a vital service since domains typically automatically renew at the registry which can be costly if not deleted on time.
It also handles various reconciliations with the registries to verify accurate inventory.
